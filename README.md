# Purescript-EReader 

I own an inky-impression, which is an eink display.
There's a dearth of Gui shells for these.
This is a WIP of one, written in Purescript, using pythonia to bind to the python raspberry-pi apis

It's early days, but the plan is to build an FRP framework around.

* 4 button inputs
* paletized (7 colour) images
* very very slow screen updates
* the need to save and restore state on power failure

We'll see how this goes
